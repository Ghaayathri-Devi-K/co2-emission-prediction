![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99457944/186589290-346d5c75-c719-48ee-b898-164a7eac0334.png)


Datasets used provide model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.
To help us compare vehicles from different model years, the fuel consumption ratings for 1995 to 2014 vehicles have been adjusted to reflect the improved testing that is more representative of everyday driving.

## Dataset used
Fuel Consumption of the vehicles along with their CO2 Emissions are available.
